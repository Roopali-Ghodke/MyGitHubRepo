# MyGroceryList

Description - This is a short project to demonstrate how you can display data by binding controls in an HTML template to properties of an Angular component.
In this page, you'll create a component with a list of grocery items. You'll display the list of grocery names and conditionally show a message below the list.
Contents -
1) Showing component properties with interpolation - [Interpolation - it uses template expressions in double curly braces to display data from the component class and 
template reference variables]
2) Showing an array property with NgFor [ngFor - ngFor used to display an array of items.].
3) Conditional display with NgIf [ngIf - ngIf used to conditionally display a chunk of HTML based on a boolean expression.].
